        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Microsoft is already undoing some of the limits it placed on Bing AI..</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">February 18, 2023 by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/21/23608888/microsoft-bing-ai-edge-chatbot-conversation-limits">The Verge</a></p>

        <p>Last week, Microsoft limited how much people could talk to Bing, and after complaints, it’s expanding access again.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Microsoft is already loosening restrictions it recently placed on interactions with the Bing AI chatbot and said it’s going to start testing another option that lets users choose the tone of the chat, with options for Precise (shorter, more focused answers), Creative (longer and more chatty), or Balanced for a bit of both.</p>
        <h2>What you should know:</h2>
        <p>Buckle up developers and testers</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <h5>Performance and Reviews:</h5>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Now it’s turned that back up to six chat turns per session with a max of 60 chats per day for any testers who have access, and the post on its blog says the plan is to increase the daily cap to 100 sessions soon and allow searches that don’t count against the chat total..</p>
        <p>Microsoft has said it didn’t “fully envision” people using the Bing AI bot as social entertainment, but with even experienced tech reporters failing this version of the mirror test, it introduced new guardrails.

        Ars Technica reported that commenters on Reddit complained about last week’s limit, saying Microsoft “lobotomized her,” “neutered” the AI, and that it was “a shell of its former self.”</p>

        <h2>The CDPR Releases </h2>
        <p>CD Projekt Red has pulled back the curtains on its game development pipeline, revealing a brand new Cyberpunk game, multiple new Witcher games, and even a new IP. 

        This news comes by way of the studio's investor call today, in which the studio revealed Orion, the codename for its next Cyberpunk game. Not much else was revealed, but CDPR says Orion "will take the Cyberpunk franchise further and continue harnessing the potential of this dark future universe." .</p>
        <p>Up next was The Witcher. CDPR has revealed that its next Witcher game, which was announced earlier this year, is being developed under the codename Polaris. The studio says "it is the beginning of a new saga" and that it aims to release two more Witcher games after Polaris, creating a new AAA RPG Witcher trilogy. </p>
        <h5>The comeback:</h5>
        <p>CDPR has since been working hard to get the fans back to thier games. The first step is ofcourse acceptance. They've also released a timeline for their future updates. </p>
